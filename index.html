                    <p>In this project, I successfully combined client-side and server-side tracking to enhance advertising performance on platforms like Facebook Ads and Google Ads. This approach became crucial in light of the iOS 14 update, which introduced challenges for third-party tracking. By integrating Google Analytics with server-side tracking, we not only overcame the limitations imposed by iOS 14 but also ensured precise data collection, heightened security, and advanced data processing. This comprehensive solution proved indispensable for maintaining effective ad campaigns in the face of evolving privacy regulations and platform changes.</p>
